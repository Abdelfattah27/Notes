Documentation of the graduation project

is about creating a new image extension that allows users to control and zoom in on various parts of a single image. This means that instead of having a video recording of a stadium or any location, you would have a single still image that a user can interact with easily. For example, you could have an image of a stadium, and a user could zoom in on the field or the stands by using an AI-powered zoom feature.

With this extension, you would have multiple images within one image, and users could switch between them seamlessly. This would allow them to have reference images of different parts of the location while still having them all in one place. For instance, you could have a reference image of the field and a reference image of the stands, and users could switch between them with just a few clicks.

This project could be beneficial for commercial use in e-commerce and real estate markets. For example, in e-commerce, it would allow customers to view a product from multiple angles within one image, making the shopping experience more interactive and engaging. In the real estate market, it could provide potential buyers with a better sense of the layout and features of a property without requiring them to be physically present.

we are currently at the stage of documenting our project, and we would appreciate any suggestions or recommendations you may have regarding the documentation process. Specifically, I would like to know if there are any specific requirements that I need to adhere to in terms of structure or content.
