# Questions

- what possible structure of the application
  - peer to peer (P2P)
  - client server
  - Hybrid of P2P and client server
- what distinguish the server
  - always have permanent ip address
  - always on a host
- what distinguish the client
  - they communicate with servers and don't communicate directly with other clients
  - may have a dynamic ip address
  - may intermittently connected
- what's P2P architecture
  - it's architecture where the arbitrary end systems are communicate
  - peers request service from other peers which provide service ,it's self scalability as new peers bring new service capacity based on service demands
  - peers are intermittently connected and exchange ip addresses, so it complex management
- what's process
  - it's a program running within a host
- whats the intra process communications
  - process in the same host communicating using OS
- process in deferent hosts communicate by exchanging messages
- what's client process
  - process that initiate the communication
- what's server process
  - process that waits to be connected
- P2P arch, apps have client and server process
- what's a socket
  - is the interface between app layer and transport layer
  - it's a programming interface API with with the program is built
- from transport layer view what the programmer can do
  - choice of the transport layer protocol
  - ability to fx some parameters
- what address processes ?
  - the port number address the process running on the host
  - the ip can't because there are many process running on the host
- what functionality does the app layer provide
  - types of messages (request of response)
  - message syntax
    - field of message
    - how field are delineated
  - message semantics
    - meaning of information in fields
  - rules
    - when and how process send and respond to messages
- give example of proprietary protocol
  - skype
- what's open protocol
  - protocols can any one uses and it defined by the RFCs and allowed for interoperability
- what transport services does the app need
  - data reliability
    - some apps eed 100% data reliability transfer like file sharing
    - some are timing is the critical thing and the reliability not much critical
  - timing
    - internet telephone calls and video need low delay to be effective
  - throughput
    - some apps need minimum throughput to word effective like multimedia other are elastic
- what tcp service provides ccfr
  - connection oriented setup between sender and receiver
  - congestion control, regulate sender when network overloaded
  - flow control
  - reliable data transfer
- what tcp service nt provide
  - timing guarantee
  - minimum throughput guarantee
  - security
- what's SSL
  - it's a thin layer above the transport layer
  - provide the security for tcp
  - provide data integrity, end point authentication, encrypted tcp connection
